# 🧠 Codeline Recall – Your AI-Powered Chat Memory Bot

Codeline Recall is a [smart Telegram bot](https://t.me/cod3linebot) that helps you **search through chat history like magic**.  
Just type `/find {what you vaguely remember}` — and the bot finds the **most relevant messages**, including media.

It's like **semantic Ctrl+F** for Telegram.
